Medical Meds Control and Calendar App
My father is a kidney transplant patient.
The first six months after the transplant he has to keep rigorous control of medication and appointments with the doctor.
This future App will be designed for this type of patient in particular.
This App could be used with any other organ transplant patient not before further study on the specifics of each patient.

This is all an idea for now. It still needs polishing.
I am considering there should be two apps, one for the patient and one for the doctor but at the same time linked to each other since the doctor changes the medication and dosage every month.

ItÂ´s still on the go. Wish me luck!
